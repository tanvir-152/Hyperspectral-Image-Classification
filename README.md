# Thesis_Codes
My Thesis Codes on Hyperspectral Image Classification. Basic CNN along with GCN was implemented. A mini-batch version of GCN called MINIGCN was also implemented. Finally 2DCNN and MINIGCN was fused to make fusion nets by addition, multiplication and concatenation. Then an updated version of the funet-M, Weighted Multiplication was implemented.
